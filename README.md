LOOK AT THE MASTER NOTEBOOK

We are evaluating the crime scenario in London's boroughs between 2011 and 2016 and exploring the impact of certain influences in elevating / reducing the levels of crime. These influences include the levels of unemployment in the population of London, the levels of unemployment by age, gender, ethnic group and disability, and the number of NEET (not in education, employment or training) youth, to name a few. 

The stakeholders of our analysis will include: 
•    Govt organisations, policy makers, NGOs who decide resource allocation for strategic decision-making
•    Representatives from police, law enforcement and investigative agencies to determine tactical methods to tackle crime 
•    General public for accountability of their local MPs 

The dataset consists of :

API : 'https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?lat=52.629729&lng=-1.131592&date=2017-01'
CSV : https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/unemployment-rate-region

if we find these datasets are not sufficient to answer these questions, we may refer to additional data sources 
            
Hypotheses :

1. Crime got proportionately less violent in Camden in October to November 2011 (H0: p1=p2)
2. Unemployment improved between 2009 and 2010 in London (H0: p1=p2)
3. Bicycle crime is less common in 2016 than it was in 2015 in London (H0: p1=p2) 
4. Robberies in Westminster went down from Jan 2011 and Jan 2013 (H0: p1=p2)
