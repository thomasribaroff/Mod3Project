LOOK AT THE MASTER NOTEBOOK

We are evaluating the crime scenario in London's boroughs between 2011 and 2016 and exploring the impact of certain influences in elevating / reducing the levels of crime. These influences include the levels of unemployment in the population of London, the levels of unemployment by age, gender, ethnic group and disability, and the number of NEET (not in education, employment or training) youth, to name a few. 

The stakeholders of our analysis will include: 
•    Govt organisations, policy makers, NGOs who decide resource allocation for strategic decision-making
•    Representatives from police, law enforcement and investigative agencies to determine tactical methods to tackle         crime 
•    General public for accountability of their local MPs 

The dataset consists of :

API : 'https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?lat=52.629729&lng=-1.131592&date=2017-01'
CSV : https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/unemployment-rate-region

if we find these datasets are not sufficient to answer these questions, we may refer to additional data sources 
            
Hypotheses :

1. Crime got proportionately more violent in Camden between 2011 and 2016
2. Crime got proportionately more violent south of the river than north of the river between 2011 and 2016
3. Has petty crime increased in this time period?
4. Is there a higher proportion of male criminals in London compared to the rest of UK?
5. Is there any significant difference between incidence of crime amongst males 16-24 and females 16-24?
6. Knife crime has gotten worse over the last 12 months in England and Wales
